# Kultra-Mega-Stores-Inventory-PROJECT
This is my one of Case Study (Project) to work on as a Data Analyst during Incubator Hub Program

# $${\color{blue}INTRODUCTION}$$
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a Lagos-based retail company specializing in office supplies and furniture. The company serves a diverse customer base comprising individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale) throughout Lagos, Nigeria. As part of KMS’s expansion and performance tracking efforts in the Abuja division, I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support data-driven decision-making. My role involves analyzing historical order data provided, which spans the period from 2009 to 2012. Using SQL skills, I will examine this dataset to uncover key business insights. These insights aim to support the Abuja division’s strategy in areas such as customer segmentation, sales performance, product demand, and operational efficiency. The analysis will be guided by some given case scenarios, and the final output will include actionable findings, visualizations, and recommendations based on trends and patterns observed in the data.

# $${\color{blue}OBJECTIVE \space \space STATEMENT}$$

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate historical sales and order data for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) with the goal of identifying key business insights that can inform strategic decisions for the Abuja division. Specifically, the analysis aims to:
- Understand sales trends and performance across customer segments (individual, retail, and wholesale)
- Identify high-performing products and underperforming categories
- Analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns
- Uncover operational inefficiencies or opportunities for process improvement
- Provide data-driven recommendations to support the Abuja division’s business growth

This will be achieved through structured SQL queries and data modeling techniques, as acquired during the DSA Class, applied to the (KMS)  2009–2012 order dataset.

# $${\color{blue}PROJECT \space METHODOLOGY}$$

The methodology for this project follows a structured approach to ensure accurate, actionable, and insightful analysis of Kultra Mega Stores’ (KMS) order data from 2009 to 2012. The steps below outline the process used to address both case scenarios shared by the Business Manager, using SQL and business analysis techniques:

  1.  ## **$${\color{Lightblue}Business \space Context}$$**
      - **Company:** Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)
      - **Division of Interest:** Abuja
      - **Products:** Office supplies and furniture
      - **Customer Segments:** Individual, Retail (small businesses), Wholesale (large corporate clients)
      - **Goal:** Provide key insights based on sales data (2009–2012) to support decision-making for the Abuja branch.

  2. ## **$${\color{Lightblue}Analysis \space \space Objectives \space Case \space Scenario \space I}$$**
     - Which product category had the highest sales?

     - What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?

     - What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?

     - Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers

     - KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

  3. ## **$${\color{Lightblue}Case \space Scenario \space II}$$**
     - Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?

     - Which small business customer had the highest sales?

     - Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 – 2012?

     - Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?

     - Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?

     - If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer.
    
  4. ## **$${\color{Lightblue}Data \space Preparation(ETL \space Process)}$$**
 - **Extraction**
   - Extraction was done by using excel tools and the file was saved in Csv format in other to be loaded in to SQL Properly

 - **Transformation** 
(Data cleaning and Structured):
     - Removal of duplicates

     - Standardize column names

     - Data types are appropriate Ensured (e.g., dates, numeric)
 - **Loading**
     - Cleaned data was loaded into SQL Database
